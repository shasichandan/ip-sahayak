/**
 * Drilldown Menu — a list that drills into itself.
 *
 * Clicking a row with children does not push a panel over the top. The row
 * stays exactly where it is, fades to grey, grows a return arrow in the gutter,
 * and its children arrive one indent step further right. Click the breadcrumb
 * to come back out.
 *
 * Movement craft — most of it is about NOT moving:
 *  - Rows are placed absolutely, by index, on a grid of one `ROW_PITCH`. A row
 *    that leaves takes no space with it, so nothing behind it has to reflow.
 *    Left in normal flow, leaving rows hold their space for a frame, arriving
 *    rows lay out around them, and then the whole list has to spring back
 *    together from wherever that put it — well over a hundred pixels of travel
 *    per row for a change that should read as a crossfade.
 *  - Rows are one flat list keyed by id. Trail rows and choices are siblings,
 *    so the row you clicked is the same element before and after and simply
 *    travels; it is never destroyed on one side and rebuilt on the other.
 *  - Nothing moves sideways. Indent is a function of the depth an item lives
 *    at, not of what is open, so becoming a breadcrumb is a pure vertical move
 *    and the label never slides out from under the cursor that clicked it.
 *  - Arriving rows do not travel at all. They are born at their final spot.
 *
 * The text carries the transition instead: each label is set per character, and
 * the characters scale and unblur into place on a short stagger, then reverse
 * out back-to-front. Only the block's height animates, so the stack breathes
 * around its centre as the row count changes.
